 Given a string and a list of words, find all the starting indices of substrings in the 
 given string that are a concatenation of all the given words exactly once without any 
 overlapping of words. It is given that all words are of the same length.
 
 Input: String="catfoxcat", Words=["cat", "fox"]
 Output: [0, 3]  ->  The two substring containing both the words are "catfox" & "foxcat".

/*
 Time: O(n * m * len) 
   ‘n’ is the number of characters in the given string, 
   ‘m’ is the total number of words, 
   ‘len’ is the length of a word.
 Space: O(m) 
   at most, we will be storing all the words in the two HashMaps. 
   the worst case, we also need O(n) space for the resulting list. 
   So, the overall space complexity of the algorithm will be O(n + m).
